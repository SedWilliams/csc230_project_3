## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS  

Given a Nx17 matrix containing 15 features (0 ir 1), an index, and a label
build a model that will correctly predict and display the data in 5x3 format grid.

### Bonus

Write a NLP (Natural Language Processing) program to predict the fourth word in
a sentence given the data in the spreadsheet.

You learned to make predictions from bit features, now try to go from the word data
to create bit features to make predictions.
